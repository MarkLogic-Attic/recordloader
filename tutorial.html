<h2>RecordLoader: Ingesting XML with Knife, Fork, and Shovel</h2>
<div class="author">Michael Blakeley</div>
<div class="date">Last updated 2010-08-25</div>
<br />
<p>
<em><strong>Note:</strong>
Starting with MarkLogic 6, <a href="http://developer.marklogic.com/products/mlcp">Marklogic Content Pump (mlcp)</a>
is a fully-supported tool that covers the same ground as this long-standing open source project.
<a href="http://developer.marklogic.com/products/mlcp">Content Pump</a> is not supported on older versions
of MarkLogic Server. Stick with recordloader (and this tutorial) if you are running earlier versions of MarkLogic.</em>
</p>
<p>
When you first learned to use XQuery and MarkLogic Server,
you probably brought XML into the database
using <code>xdmp:load()</code>
or <code>xdmp:document-load()</code>.
Or maybe you prefer to use WebDAV - just drag and drop.
But sometimes those tools aren't enough.
Sometimes you need RecordLoader.
</p>

<p>
Use RecordLoader when...
</p>
<ul>
        <li>You have large XML files,
  which need to be broken up into smaller documents.</li>
        <li>Your XML file is too big to fit in main memory.</li>
        <li>Your XML isn't encoded as UTF-8.</li>
        <li>You want to load XML directly from a zip archive.</li>
        <li>You want to redirect standard output into new documents.</li>
        <li>You want to be able to resume interrupted loads.</li>
        <li>You need multiple, parallel loads.</li>
      </ul>

<p>RecordLoader can do all this quickly and easily.
Along the way, it can...
</p>
<ul>
        <li>Automatically generate document URIs.</li>
        <li>Read a unique document ID from an attribute or element.</li>
        <li>Set read permissions on every new document.</li>
        <li>Set collections on every new document.</li>
        <li>Add a prefix to every new document URI.</li>
        <li>Append a suffix to every new document URI.</li>
        <li>Place new documents in one or more specific Forests.</li>
        <li>Skip (or overwrite) existing documents.</li>
        <li>Continue despite errors, or stop at the first problem.</li>
        <li>Ignore elements that aren't important.</li>
      </ul>

<a name="setup"></a>
<h3><a name="n6c6f8bab28498f40"></a>Setting up RecordLoader</h3>
<p>
RecordLoader is a Java program, and requires a Java 1.5 environment.
If you don't have Java 1.5,
<a href="http://oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/">download</a>
and install it.
</p>
<p>First, we'll need RecordLoader itself. So download
<a href="recordloader.jar">recordloader.jar</a>.
</p>
<p>Since RecordLoader works by connecting to a MarkLogic Server,
you'll need the Mark Logic XCC libraries, too.
You can download the MarkXCC.Java zip archive
<a href="http://developer.marklogic.com/products">here</a>.
Be sure to download the latest XCC for Java release!
After you download the zip archive, unpack it and find the jar files.
You can put <code>xcc.jar</code> anywhere on your disk,
but for this tutorial I'll assume
that both files are in the current directory.
</p>
<p>
Finally, you'll need a copy of XPP3. You can download it from
<a href="http://www.extreme.indiana.edu/dist/java-repository/xpp3/jars/">
this site</a>.
Again, be sure to get the latest version: right now, that's
<code>xpp3-1.1.3_8.jar</code>.
</p>

<a name="running"></a>
<h3><a name="n6c6f8bab4d356158"></a>Running RecordLoader</h3>

<p>Now that we have a Java environment and all the libraries we need,
let's try it out with the simplest possible invocation.
</p>

<div class="code-block">
java -cp recordloader.jar:xcc.jar:xpp3.jar \
  com.marklogic.ps.RecordLoader
</div>

<p>Java command lines can get pretty ugly. I'll keep using them
for this tutorial, but you might want to put all of that into
a shell script (or a batch file, on Windows).
Remember, I put all my jar files in the current directory.
You might have used another location:
if so, just change the classpath in your command-line to match.
</p>

<p>OK, so we copied that command-line and pasted it into a shell.
What happened?
</p>

<div class="code-block">
java -cp recordloader.jar:xcc.jar:xpp3.jar \
  com.marklogic.ps.RecordLoader
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/marklogic/ps/RecordLoader
</div>

<p>Oh, that doesn't look good. Hmm... looks like we forgot to put
recordloader.jar into the current directory. We'll do that,
and try again...
</p>

<div class="code-block">
java -cp recordloader.jar:xcc.jar:xpp3.jar \
  com.marklogic.ps.RecordLoader
Jun 7, 2006 2:06:40 PM com.marklogic.ps.RecordLoader main
INFO: RecordLoader starting, version 2006-06-07.1
Exception in thread "main" java.io.IOException: missing required property: ID_NAME
        at com.marklogic.ps.RecordLoader.main(RecordLoader.java:465)
</div>

<p>That looks a little bit better: we see a startup message,
which incidentally tells us which version of RecordLoader we have.
That could be important to know.
</p>

<p>But what about the error? What does
<code>missing required property: ID_NAME</code> mean?
ID_NAME is the name of a property. In Java, properties are
simply name-value pairs, such as <code>SIZE=1</code>
or <code>PATH=/lib/java</code>.
RecordLoader uses properties for almost everything:
let's learn how to configure those properties.
</p>

<a name="configuration"></a>
<h3><a name="n6c6f8bab76beadb3"></a>RecordLoader Configuration</h3>
<p>RecordLoader configures itself by looking at the System properties,
plus any property files that you supply on the command-line.
We'll learn about property files in a minute.
But for now, we just want to load a simple XML file.
To do this, we only need a couple of properties:
<code>ID_NAME</code>
and <code>CONNECTION_STRING</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>ID_NAME</code> is the name of an element or an attribute
that RecordLoader can use as a unique ID for the input XML.
RecordLoader will use this unique ID
as part of the final document URI.
If you use an attribute, put <code>@</code> in front of its name.
For example, if you are processing Medline XML,
you might set <code>ID_NAME=PMID</code>.
For XML that uses an attribute named 'id',
you would set <code>ID_NAME=@id</code>.
</p>

<p>There's also a special value
<code>ID_NAME=#AUTO</code>,
tells RecordLoader to make up its own ids for the
documents it inserts, starting with 1 and counting up.
This should be used only with caution, since it
gives you very little control over your final document URIs.
</p>

<p>Next, RecordLoader needs to know how to connect to MarkLogic Server:
that's where <code>CONNECTION_STRING</code> comes in.
The default value is <code>xcc://admin:admin@localhost:9000</code>.
That will work, as long as you've set up an XDBC server
that listens on port 9000, points at the right database,
and has a user named 'admin' (password 'admin')
with enough privileges to write to the database.
I'm going to use the default value for this tutorial,
but if you need to use another username, password, host, or port,
then you'll have to set <code>CONNECTION_STRING</code>.
</p>

<p>
If you're looking at the required properties in the README file,
you might notice that <code>INPUT_PATH</code> isn't required,
and defaults to null. If it isn't set, RecordLoader
looks for XML on the <i>standard input</i> stream. This allows
you to uncompress a large file and pipe the resulting XML
directly to RecordLoader. You can pipe the result of
any command to RecordLoader in this way:
note that the resulting XML must look like a single document
to RecordLoader.
See the "Wikipedia" use-case, below, for an example of this technique.
</p>

<a name="medline"></a>
<h3><a name="n6c6f8babab5b85e2"></a>Use Case: Medline</h3>

<p>Now that we have a working configuration,
let's try it out. We'll use Medline content,
from the
<a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/">National Library of Medicine</a>.
You can download a sample file
<a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/dtd/medsamp2006.xml">here</a>.
The sample file, <code>medsamp2006.xml</code> is about 372KB,
and contains 87 MedlineCitation elements.
We want to break it up so that every MedlineCitation is a new document
- and that's exactly what RecordLoader was designed to do.
</p>

<p>Looking at the structure of  <code>medsamp2006.xml</code>,
we decide that the unique element is <code>PMID</code>.
So here's how we can run RecordLoader:
</p>

<div class="code-block">
java -cp recordloader.jar:xcc.jar:xpp3.jar \
  -DID_NAME=PMID \

INFO: loaded 88 records ok (4842 ms, 368375 B, 18 tps, 74 kB/s)
</div>

<p>That was pretty quick. What happened?
</p>

<p>First, we saw some messages from RecordLoader,
telling us that it's using UTF-8
for both input and output character encoding.
Next, we see the full path to the Medline XML sample.
Toward the end, we saw a progress message every 3 seconds
- and at the very end, we saw confirmation that
we loaded 88 new documents into the database.
</p>

<p>RecordLoader looks at its input XML for new "records".
Each record is simply an XML element that wants to be inserted
into the MarkLogic database as a new document.
The default behavior is to break up the input XML
based on the name of the first element it sees below the root element:
in our simple test, that was the element named <code>MedlineCitation</code>,
which was exactly what we wanted.
</p>

<p>Didn't the NLM say that there were 87 sample records?
It turns out that they lied: there are 88.
We can confirm this with a simple XQuery:
</p>

<div class="code-block">
for $i at $x in /MedlineCitation
return text {{ $x, xdmp:node-uri($i) }}

=&gt;
1 medsamp2006/12230355
2 medsamp2006/12230384
3 medsamp2006/12742516
4 medsamp2006/12742518
5 medsamp2006/12742519
[ ...skipping a few... ]
84 medsamp2006/15206831
85 medsamp2006/10389168
86 medsamp2006/9634358
87 medsamp2006/11731716
88 medsamp2006/15278624
</div>

<p>That's interesting: the new document URIs all start with 'medsamp2006/'.
That's because RecordLoader automatically prefixes every document
with the base name of the input file: in this case, that's medsamp2006.
If we set <code>OUTPUT_URI_PREFIX=/foo/</code>, all the URIs
will start will '/foo/medsamp2006/'.
If we set <code>OUTPUT_URI_SUFFIX=.xml</code>,
every new URI will end with '.xml'.
</p>

<p>If we set up a WebDAV server with a root of 'medsamp2006/',
we can view these documents via any WebDAV client.
Or we could query by URI. Either way, let's look at the first document:
</p>

<div class="code-block">
&lt;MedlineCitation Owner="NLM" Status="MEDLINE"&gt;
&lt;PMID&gt;12230355&lt;/PMID&gt;
&lt;DateCreated&gt;
&lt;Year&gt;2002&lt;/Year&gt;
&lt;Month&gt;09&lt;/Month&gt;
&lt;Day&gt;16&lt;/Day&gt;
&lt;/DateCreated&gt;
&lt;DateCompleted&gt;
&lt;Year&gt;2002&lt;/Year&gt;
&lt;Month&gt;09&lt;/Month&gt;
&lt;Day&gt;25&lt;/Day&gt;
&lt;/DateCompleted&gt;
&lt;DateRevised&gt;
&lt;Year&gt;2005&lt;/Year&gt;
&lt;Month&gt;11&lt;/Month&gt;
&lt;Day&gt;17&lt;/Day&gt;
&lt;/DateRevised&gt;
&lt;Article PubModel="Print"&gt;
&lt;Journal&gt;
&lt;ISSN IssnType="Electronic"&gt;1539-3704&lt;/ISSN&gt;
[ ...etc ]
</div>

<p>There's one more wrinkle here:
if we look at <code>medsamp2006.xml</code>,
we find that the <code>PMID</code> element appears
as a child of <code>MedlineCitation</code>,
but sometimes its also a lower-level descendant,
two levels underneath <code>MedlineCitation/CommentsCorrections</code>.
That's ok: the <code>PMID</code> that we want, and that RecordLoader will use,
always comes immediately after the <code>MedlineCitation</code> element.
</p>

<p>What if we have more that one XML file?
The full Medline distribution has hundreds of files,
each with up to 30,000 MedlineCitation elements.
Some are 100MB of XML, or more.
But RecordLoader handles them easily,
because it uses a pull-based parser to stream through the input.
Let's tell RecordLoader to load everything in a directory:
</p>

<div class="code-block">
java -cp recordloader.jar:xcc.jar:xpp3.jar \
  -DID_NAME=PMID \
  com.marklogic.ps.RecordLoader /tmp/medline/*.xml
</div>

<p>If you have too many files, though, shell expansion will fail.
In that case, we can use another property, <code>INPUT_PATH</code>.
RecordLoader will find and load every XML file in <code>INPUT_PATH</code>,
as long as it ends with <code>.xml</code>.
We can match other filename patterns by setting
<code>INPUT_PATTERN</code> to a (Java-style) regular expression.
</p>

<p>Also, we want to skip any existing documents with the same URI,
in case we're resuming an interrupted load.</p>

<div class="code-block">
java -cp recordloader.jar:xcc.jar:xpp3.jar \
  -DID_NAME=PMID -DINPUT_PATH=/tmp/medline -DSKIP_EXISTING=true \
  com.marklogic.ps.RecordLoader
</div>

<p>Whew - that's getting to be too ugly. Let's clean it up.
We can put all the properties in a file.
We'll call it <code>medline.properties</code>:
we could use pretty much any name, but it should end with ".properties".
</p>

<div class="code-block">
ID_NAME=PMID
INPUT_PATH=/tmp/medline
SKIP_EXISTING=true
THREADS=4
</div>

<p>Now we might want to create a shell script to hold the java command
and that ugly classpath. Let's call it <code>recordloader.sh</code>:
</p>

<div class="code-block">
#!/bin/sh
#

CP=$HOME/lib/java/recordloader.jar
CP=$CP:$HOME/lib/java/xcc.jar
CP=$CP:$HOME/lib/java/xpp3.jar

java -cp $CP com.marklogic.ps.RecordLoader $*

# end recordloader.sh
</div>

<p>We can use <code>chmod +x recordloader.sh</code> to make it executable,
and now our command-line is simple:
</p>

<div class="code-block">
./recordloader.sh medline.properties
</div>

<p>Ah, that's better. Now I can move all the jar files into
a common <code>$HOME/lib/java</code> directory,
where I keep all my third-party jars.
</p>

<p>Did you notice the other change?
We added <code>THREADS=4</code> to the new properties file.
Now RecordLoader will start a thread for each input file,
up to 4 threads at a time.
</p>

<p>But loading all of Medline will still take a little while:
probably hours, maybe days. What happens if the power goes off?
We can resume from where we left off!
</p>

<p>At the most basic level, we can use <code>SKIP_EXISTING=true</code>
to skip past any existing documents.
But using SKIP_EXISTING, RecordLoader will query the database
for every new URI it generates.
That's better than nothing, but not as fast as we'd like.
</p>

<p>If we look in the RecordLoader output, though,
we can find out the last PMID that was successfully loaded.
Then we set <code>START_ID</code> to that value:
RecordLoader will process XML until it reaches the supplied value,
and then it will start inserting documents.
It's best to resume using both <code>SKIP_EXISTING=true</code>
and <code>START_ID</code>, so that you minimize
the amount of work to be done.
</p>

<p>Note that it isn't safe to use START_ID with multiple threads:
the threads won't know which file contains the START_ID record,
which causes problems.
If you're interested in enhancing RecordLoader to solve this problem,
patches are welcome.
</p>

<a name="wikipedia"></a>
<h3><a name="n6c6f8bac5531e5ea"></a>Use Case: Wikipedia</h3>

<p>Let's look at an uglier case: wikipedia.
The <a href="http://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> project
is one of the largest sources of freely available content on the net,
and database dumps can be downloaded from
<a href="http://download.wikimedia.org/">http://download.wikimedia.org/</a>.
The largest file is <code>pages-meta-history.xml</code>:
it contains the complete history of every article,
plus discussion and user pages.
The bzip2-compressed XML download for enwiki-20060518 is 33 GB,
and the uncompressed size is over 300 GB.
That's a lot of XML.
</p>

<p>Can RecordLoader handle it? Yes, but we need to be careful.
First, let's take a quick look at the first few lines of the XML:
</p>

<div class="code-block">
$ bunzip2 --stdout enwiki-20060518-pages-meta-history.xml.bz2 | head -40
&lt;mediawiki xmlns="http://www.mediawiki.org/xml/export-0.3/"

    &lt;case&gt;first-letter&lt;/case&gt;
      &lt;namespaces&gt;
      &lt;namespace key="-2"&gt;Media&lt;/namespace&gt;
[ ...etc... ]
    &lt;/namespaces&gt;
  &lt;/siteinfo&gt;
  &lt;page&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;AaA&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;id&gt;1&lt;/id&gt;
    &lt;revision&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;233181&lt;/id&gt;

      &lt;contributor&gt;
        &lt;username&gt;JimboWales&lt;/username&gt;
        &lt;id&gt;479&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;/contributor&gt;
      &lt;comment&gt;*&lt;/comment&gt;
[ ...etc... ]
</div>

<p>
We decide that each <code>page</code> element will become a document,
and that the URIs will be based on the <code>page/id</code> element.
But there's also a <code>siteinfo</code> element, which is a sibling
of <code>page</code>, and appears before it in the document.
If we don't do something about that,
RecordLoader will automatically decide to use <code>siteinfo</code>
as the document root, and then complain when it sees <code>page</code>
at the same level of the input XML.
</p>

<p>We can fix this using two new properties:
<code>RECORD_NAME</code> tells RecordLoader which element to use
as the output document root element,
and <code>IGNORE_UNKNOWN</code> tells RecordLoader to ignore
elements that don't match <code>RECORD_NAME</code>.
Note that all the wikipedia content is in a special namespace, too,
so we have to set <code>RECORD_NAMESPACE</code>
as well as <code>RECORD_NAME</code>.
So our <code>wikipedia.properties</code> file is:
</p>

<div class="code-block">
#CONNECTION_STRING=xcc://user:password@hostname:portnumber
ID_NAME=id
RECORD_NAME=page
RECORD_NAMESPACE=http://www.mediawiki.org/xml/export-0.3/
IGNORE_UNKNOWN=true
OUTPUT_COLLECTIONS=wikipedia
URI_PREFIX=/wikipedia/
URI_SUFFIX=.xml
DEFAULT_NAMESPACE=org.wikipedia.content
</div>

<p>
We added an XCC connection string, but it's commented out because
we're still using the default value, from before.
Given this configuration, RecordLoader will insert each new document
as a member of the collection 'wikipedia', too.
And did you notice the <code>DEFAULT_NAMESPACE</code>?
That will actually override the existing namespace in the input XML
with our own choice of namespace.
Why would we want to do that? Just to show that we can.
</p>

<p>But what about <code>INPUT_PATH</code> and <code>INPUT_PATTERN</code>?
How will RecordLoader find the input XML?
It turns out that if we omit any input path,
RecordLoader tries to read from standard input.
This is especially handy for this giant compressed XML file,
because I don't want to actually uncompress it onto my disk.
Instead, I can pipe the output of <code>bunzip2</code>
directly into RecordLoader.
</p>

<div class="code-block">
bunzip2 --stdout enwiki-20060518-pages-meta-history.xml.bz2 \
  | ./recordloader.sh wikipedia.properties
</div>

<p>
Don't try to run that command just yet, though: you'll almost certainly
hit a fatal <code>XDMP-FRAGTOOLARGE</code> error.
This is because our input <code>page</code> elements are sometimes very large.
Since the input pages are in alphabetical order, we see the first
problem when we reach the entry for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy">Anarchy</a>.
</p>

<p>It turns out that some pages are very controversial,
and undergo "revision wars".
This causes these <code>page</code> elements
to contain lots of <code>revision</code> children,
which makes some pages too large to fit into MarkLogic Server's
default memory limits.
We could increase those limits, but in cases like this,
it makes more sense to break up the documents somehow.
Now, we don't want to create a separate document for every revision:
that would make it difficult to retain the page-level data.

<p>
Instead, we tell MarkLogic Server to <i>fragment</i> the document.
We won't go into the details of fragments here:
just remember to create a fragment root on
namespace <code>org.wikipedia.content</code>
and local-name <code>revision</code>,
before you start RecordLoader.
</p>

<p>Note that loading all of wikipedia will take a while.
This time, we can't use <code>THREADS</code> to speed it up,
either. That's because RecordLoader only knows how to
spawn threads for input files. This XML is arriving through
standard input, which is roughly the same thing as having
just one input file.

<h3><a name="n6c6f8bacddcda276"></a>Troubleshooting</h3>

<p><b><code>NoClassDefFoundError</code></b>:
Your classpath isn't finding one
of the jar files. Examine it carefully, and make sure the paths are
all accurate.
</p>

<p><b>I'm running Windows, and RecordLoader is ignoring my
<code>INPUT_PATH</code> property</b>:
Try escaping all the back-slash characters in your path.
For example, change <code>c:\foo</code> to <code>c:\\foo</code>
- alternatively, change back-slashes to forward-slashes.
